# 📘 Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow  

This repository contains my **hands-on practice, notes, and learning materials** while working through the book:  

> **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow (3rd Edition)** by Aurélien Géron  

It serves as both my personal study log and a reference for anyone else learning machine learning with Python, Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow.
